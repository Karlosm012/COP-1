Folder containing a group project written during our Object Oriented Programming class in Spring 2021

The base of the project is creating a program which takes in different types of people in a university: Student, Staff and Faculty. Staff is for people that are not 
professors or adjuncts, while faculty are the professor and adjuncts in a university. For the students, the user inputs their name, GPA, credit hours and ID. For the
faculty, they input their name, department, ID, and rank. For the staff, they input their name, department, worktime (if they are part time or full time), and ID. And 
outputs the information inputted based on their name and their unique IDs.

The program's output for Student gives them their tuition cost based on credit hours and if they have a GPA higher than 3.85, they get a discount in their tuition cost.
The program's output for Faculty gives them their name, id, department, and their rank.
The program's output for Staff gives them their name, id and their status as part time or full time.
